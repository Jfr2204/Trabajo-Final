Marfan Syndrome

It is a connective tissue disorder. This tissue strengthens the body's structural elements.
Connective tissue disorders affect the skeletal and cardiovascular systems, as well as the eyes and skin.

Causes:
Marfan syndrome is caused by variants in a gene called fibrillin-1. This gene plays an important role as a fundamental pillar for connective tissue in the body.
The variant in the gene also causes excessive growth of the long bones in the body. People with this syndrome tend to be tall with long arms and legs. The way this exaggerated growth occurs is not fully understood.

Other areas of the body that are affected include:
-The pulmonary tissue (a pneumothorax may occur, in which air can escape from the lung into the chest cavity, collapsing the lung).
-The aorta, the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the body, can stretch or weaken (referred to as aortic dilation or aortic aneurysm).
-The heart valves.
-The eyes, leading to cataracts and other issues (such as lens dislocation).
-The skin.
-The tissue covering the spinal cord.
-The joints.

In most cases, Marfan syndrome is inherited from parents (hereditary). However, up to 30% of individuals do not have a family history, which is called "sporadic." In sporadic cases, it is believed that the syndrome is caused by a new genetic change.

Symptoms:
People with Marfan syndrome are generally tall with thin, long arms and legs, and spider-like fingers (called arachnodactyly). When they stretch their arms, the length of their arms is greater than their height.

Other symptoms include:
-A chest that is either sunken or protruding, called pectus excavatum (sunken chest) or pectus carinatum (pigeon chest).
-Flat feet.
-Highly arched palate and crowded teeth.
-Hypotonia (low muscle tone).
-Joints that are too flexible (but elbows may be less flexible).
-Learning difficulties.
-Movement of the eye lens from its normal position (lens dislocation).
-Myopia.
-Small and low jaw (micrognathia).
-Spine that curves to one side (scoliosis).
-Narrow and thin face.

Many people with Marfan syndrome suffer from chronic muscle and joint pain.

Tests and Examinations:
The healthcare provider will conduct a physical examination. The joints may move more than normal. There may also be signs of:
-Aneurysm.
-Pulmonary atelectasis.
-Problems with heart valves.
-An eye examination may reveal:
-Defects in the lens or cornea.
-Retinal detachment.
-Visual problems.
-The following tests may be carried out:
-Echocardiography.
-Fibrillin-1 mutation testing (in some individuals).
-An echocardiogram or other examination should be done every year to monitor the aorta and possibly the heart valves. Depending on the results, this test may be needed less frequently than once a year.

Treatment:
Visual problems should be treated when possible.
